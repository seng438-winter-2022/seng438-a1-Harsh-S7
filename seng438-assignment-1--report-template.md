# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

This lab was a great learning experience for the team as a whole as it allowed us to explore the world of software testing. Backlog was an integral part of the lab but it would have been a smoother experience if there had been a tutorial which outlined the onboarding process for Backlog as for our group it had been a great challenge as the website did not have a clear outline for user onboarding. The lab document had been pivotal to this lab and it had extensive coverage for the pre-requisite  knowledge required for the successful completion of this lab. The lab itself was a very good learning experience and all the notes provided were very helpful and the notes allowed us to stay on track and as they provided a step by step process to completing this lab but a more coverage on the tools section would have made it a more smoothness experience. All in all, the lab was a great first step to introduce the students to software testing requirements.
